# stochastic-human-driving-policies-drl
This repository is the implementation of the paper "Deep Reinforcement Learning for Human-Like Driving Policies in Collision Avoidance Tasks of Self-Driving Cars" (now being reviewed after an extensive revision).
Note that this project also provides the GAIL algorithm implementation as a benchmark. The results will be published soon under the revised version. It also contains a unique simulator environment and data (which will be discussed later) for training so you can replicate the results.
In short, this project is designed to find human-like driving policies using the imitative learning approach we have developed. To this end, we demonstrate our approach to relatively simple tasks - static/dynamic obstacle avoidance tasks. In the article, you will find further discussions and limitations.
